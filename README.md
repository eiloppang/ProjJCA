Analyzing knowledge circulation across Korean Literature and English Literature in Korea using KCI metadata.

---

## Introduction

This collaborative research project investigates knowledge circulation and theoretical hegemony across two disciplinary fields in the Korean academic landscape: **Korean Literature (국문학)** and **English Literature in Korea (영문학)**. Despite their scholarly affinity, these fields have long been institutionally and culturally separated, leaving the intersections between them largely unexamined.

By reframing both under a unified lens of "Literature" in Korea, this project traces how concepts and discourses transform as they travel across disciplinary boundaries. It also extends the scope of analysis to **"world literature" discourses** that exist beyond the Korean academic field, examining the dynamics of theoretical influence and knowledge transfer between domestic and international scholarship.

Crucially, this project understands knowledge not as abstract and disembodied, but as necessarily mediated by embodied actors. Accordingly, we examine how **generation, gender, and other sociocultural factors** are entangled with and intervene in these knowledge flows.

The primary data source is metadata from the **KCI (Korea Citation Index)** database.
